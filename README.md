# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm

1. First,we want to import numpy,then import sys,assume a variable.
2.For gaussian elimination method, we want to make 2nd and 3rd column zero.
3.For that we want to make a range accorting to our program output.
4.Then print the program with correct form then the output will display.

## Program:

#Program to solve a matrix using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.

#Developed by:  SRIVATSAN G 

#RegisterNumber: 212223230216

```
import numpy as np
import sys
n=int(input())
a=np.zeros((n,n+1))
x=np.zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n+1):
        a[i][j]=float(input())
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        ratio=a[j][i]/a[i][i]
        
        for k in range(n+1):
            a[j][k]=a[j][k]-ratio*a[i][k]
            
x[n-1]=a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]

for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    x[i]=a[i][n]
    
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        x[i]=x[i] - a[i][j]*x[j]
    x[i]=x[i]/a[i][i]
for i in range(n):
    print('X%d = %0.2f' %(i,x[i]),end=' ')

```

## Output:
![Screenshot 2024-05-12 195827](https://github.com/vatsan143/Gaussian/assets/147368204/b875d34e-2425-452a-b0b7-6f69e6c0138b)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
